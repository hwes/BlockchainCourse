# BlockchainCourse

This repo contains the code for the blockchain course that I sometimes run.
It demonstrates modular arithmetic, contains a simple Diffie Hellman public key exhange as well as the code to break it,
a simple Pearson hashing implementation and a full transaction verification with nonce
